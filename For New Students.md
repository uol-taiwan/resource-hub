</aside>

### **To Do List**

- Finish Orientation course on Coursera before `Term start date`
    
    Or else you won't get access to your registered modules !!
    
- Add all channels of the modules you're taking (i.e. `#cm1005-intro-prog-i`)
    
    Use the `browse channels` feature to check out interesting channels
    
    All module channels starts with `cm + courseCode`
    
    ((There might be some unofficial modules channels people created themselves, 
    
    if the numbers of people are too low, you might want to check with other people))
    
- Get familiar with the Coursera platform
- Get familiar with Slack interface (be active !! this is the most valuable thing in this degree
    
    Search for answers before asking one
    
    Ask wise questions
    
    Don't ask graded assignment questions directly
    
    Use thread !!!
    
- [optional] [Join Discord](https://discord.gg/h4Kuhe57)
    
    (it's mainly for prospective students that doesn't have access to Slack)
    

### **Reminder (as a PBA)**

- Try not to make yourself into troubles, because the admin here is horribly slow
- You have to gain 50%+ in both `ITP1` and `DM`'s midterm coursework/assignment
- Midterm deadlines are around mid-January
- Final deadlines (or exams) are in March
    
    (exams are normally early-Mar, project deadlines are normally late-Mar)
    
- You will receive your midterm grade around final (yes, 3-month waiting period)
- You will not be able to register for term 2 before you get the grades
    
    And the registration normally closes around the time you get your grade, but this is normal, 
    
    don't worry if you didn't get them in time (unless you fail), they'll extend it for you
    
- If you decide to continue this degree, and wanting to do full-speed later on,
    
    it is strongly recommended (as a PBA) to take the [Google certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-support) to gain credit 
    
    for this `How Computers Work` module, 
    
    why? long story short, because of the progression rule, 
    
    and so that you can save money and time, and be able to take on level 5 modules 
    
    in your third term along with the remaining level 4 modules
